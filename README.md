## About the Project

The opensource self-hostable alternative to [oslash](oslash.com).

You are in charge of your own data, workflow and appearance.

URLs serve as the pathways that lead us to our desired destinations on the internet. However, traditionally, we have had limited control over the routes we take to reach those destinations. With Project CD, we strive to revolutionize URL navigation by making it as effortless as using the "cd" command in a terminal.
